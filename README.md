2.Create and rotate a triangle about the origin and a fixed point.

3.Draw a colour cube and spin it using OpenGL transformation matrices.

4.Draw a color cube and allow the user to move the camera suitably to experiment with perspective viewing.

5.Clip lines using Cohen-Sutherland algorithm

6.To draw a simple shaded scene consisting of a tea pot on a table. Define suitably the position and properties of the light source along with the properties of the surfaces of the solid object used in the scene.
